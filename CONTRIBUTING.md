# Contributing
Thanks for your interest in contributing to go-webrpc. This is an open source project and contributions are appreciated, though not all contributions will be accepted. To be safe, it's probably best if you create an issue before you begin work.

## Issues
If you're having a problem, the first thing you should do is make an attempt at troubleshooting it. There are examples and documentation that might help point you in the right direction.

If you believe you have discovered a bug or want to suggest a new feature, please [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Benzinga/go-webrpc/issues/new).

## Submitting Changes
Once you've made some changes you would like to propose, just follow the standard practice of pushing your code to a fork and submitting a pull request.

Tests that fix bugs ideally would contain regression tests, but this is not required.

Please squash minor commits and rewrite your history. Good commit messages are concise but understandable.

## Code Style
We adhere to the standard Go coding style. Make sure you have setup `gofmt` in your editor.
